# Title: Ricky Lab
What this is: This repository is my learning lab for Python, automation, and AI.

What I will build here: <br>
• Small Python programs (games, tools, experiments) <br>
• Automation scripts that save time <br>
• Beginner-friendly AI projects I can explain clearly <br>

How to use (today): I will add instructions as each project is created.
